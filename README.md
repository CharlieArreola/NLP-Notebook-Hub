1. Sentiment Analysis Notebook: Boosting Performance with GPU. 

This notebook showcases the benefits of using GPU for sentiment analysis tasks using different techniques of natural language processing (NLP) and AI to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets. We'll be using the Hugging Face library and the pre-trained CardiffNLP Twitter-Roberta-Base-Sentiment-Latest model for our analysis. In addition to the technical aspects of the notebook, we'll also discuss some general concepts about sentiment analysis, including what it is, why it's important, and how it works. The dataset used is related to Tesla's decision to build a factory in the northern border state of Nuevo Leon, calling it the "the biggest electric vehicle plant in the world." The times between execution of each version were recorded for comparison.
